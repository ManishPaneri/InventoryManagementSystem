Inventory Management System

# Problem Statement
A bookstore needs a mini inventory management system wth the followiing facilities.

1. Create Inventory
  
    Inventory is just collection of various items. Each Item can have these details: ID, name, and cost.
  
  
2. Update Item Stock.
   
   Inventory is updated whenever a new stock is received. let's take an example. When the inventory has 5 pens, we say that are 
   5 pens in stock, And when a new stock of 5 pens arrives. the inventory is updated to have a total of 10 pens in stock.


3. Checkout Item.
    When an Item is being sold, it first needs to be checked out from the invertory. Let's take an example here as well.
    When the store has 10 pens in stock, and a customer  asks for 3 pens, checkout of those 3 pens reduces the stock of pens
    from 10 to 7.

4. Generate Inventory Report.
  
    It's a simple report of all the items in the invertory. the report should indicate the ID, name, cost and the stock (count     of items) available for each item.
